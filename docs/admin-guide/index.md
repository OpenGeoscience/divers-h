# Administration Overview

## Production Deployment

!!! note

If you are deploying this for the first time, the recommended steps are as follows:

1. [Setting up TLS configuration](./deploy/tls-configuration.md)
1. [Environment Preparation](./deploy/env-prep.md)
1. [Building and running the docker services](./deploy/docker-services.md)
1. [Create the Admin User](./deploy/create-admin-user.md)
1. [Finalize the Authentication Config](./deploy/post-auth-config.md)
1. [Name Your Site](./deploy/site-name.md)

Afterwards, you can look into [ingesting your data](data-ingestion.md), [managing users](users.md), or how to [update the application](updating.md).

## User Management

To manage users, read up on the [User Management Guide](./users.md).
